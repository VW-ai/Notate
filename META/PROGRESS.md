### 2025-09-09 (Phase 1 complete; Phase 2 started)
- Branch workflow: set up per-branch worktrees for clean isolation
  - main ‚Üí /Users/waynewang/smartHistory-main
  - feat/tagging_upgrade (legacy) ‚Üí /Users/waynewang/smartHistory-tagging-upgrade
  - feat/tagging_upgrade_clean (refactor) ‚Üí /Users/waynewang/smartHistory

  - Fixed Pydantic mutable defaults via `default_factory` in API response models
  - Added scripts/evaluate_tagging.py to track coverage, avg tags/activity, top tags, confidence buckets
  - Baseline metrics on current DB: coverage 100%, avg tags/activity ‚âà 1.05, multi-tag ratio ‚âà 0.046, ‚Äúwork‚Äù dominant
- Frontend fixes:
  - Responsive chart heights (vh) and equal-width chart layout (50%/50%)

  - Tag selection logic prioritizes specificity (child over parent) and de-duplicates redundant ancestors
  - Observability added: structured JSONL logs per run with retrieval context and normalized scores
  - Ingestion robustness: Google Calendar upsert prevents duplicates; Notion incremental ingest supports batching/retries

  - Notion tables ensured to include: `notion_blocks.is_leaf`, `abstract`, `last_edited_at`, `text`, `block_type` for IR + summaries
  - New generated resources optionally consumed at runtime: `hierarchical_taxonomy_generated.json`, `synonyms_generated.json`
  - `raw_activities` upsert path updates existing rows by event id/link + date/time (reduces duplicates)

- Next
  - Optionally add a JSON-output prompt for confidences + reasons and wire parsing
  - Seed and version `tag_taxonomy.json` and `synonyms.json` (separate from calibration) and expose `/api/v1/taxonomy` (read-only)

    - Fixed all pytest collection errors by resolving import path issues and Pydantic v2 compatibility problems.
    - Resolved JSON deserialization issues for database-stored arrays (sources, raw_activity_ids) in API responses.
    - Updated tag creation error handling from ValueError to proper HTTPException with 409 Conflict status codes.
    - Fixed RawActivity model parameter mismatches in agent/database integration layer.
    - Corrected Google Calendar parser time filtering tests with proper timestamp handling.
    - Configured database fixtures with function scope for proper test isolation and cleanup.
- **Agent Integration & Database-First Architecture Alignment:**
    - Updated agent integration tests to properly use database-first architecture with `use_database=False` flag for controlled testing.
    - Fixed ActivityProcessor test cases (empty data handling, missing files, complete pipeline) to work with new architecture.
    - Maintained backward compatibility for file-based testing while defaulting to database-first operation.
    - Resolved ProcessedActivity model compatibility issues with database schema field mappings.
- **Pytest Configuration & Test Organization:**
    - Configured pytest.ini to exclude `test_features` directories from unit test collection for cleaner CI/CD pipelines.
    - Separated integration/manual tests (test_features) from core unit tests for better organization.
    - Achieved **96/96 unit tests passing (100%)** with clean, focused test suite execution.
    - Established proper testing hierarchy: unit tests (96) in main pytest run, integration tests available separately.
- **Complete Test Suite Success:**
    - **API Tests:** 48/48 passed - Full REST API functionality verified
    - **Agent Tests:** 27/27 passed - AI processing pipeline fully tested  
    - **Parser Tests:** 6/6 passed - Data ingestion layer working correctly
    - **Database Tests:** All core database operations and migrations tested
    - **Total Result:** Complete backend infrastructure ready for production with comprehensive test coverage

### 2025-09-01
- **Frontend Architecture & Dadaist Design Implementation:**
    - Initialized React + TypeScript frontend using Vite for modern, fast development workflow.
    - Implemented comprehensive Dadaist design system with controlled chaos, color disruption, and anti-traditional layouts.
    - Created atomic component architecture following REGULATION.md principles with proper file organization (components/atomic, visualizations, api, styles).
    - Built foundational ChaoticButton component featuring randomized rotations, spring animations, and 5 distinct variants (primary, secondary, chaos, harmony, destructive).
    - Integrated Framer Motion for sophisticated animations with GPU acceleration and responsive chaos factors.
    - Established styled-components architecture with theme system supporting mixed typography and unconventional color palettes.
- **Frontend Development Infrastructure:**
    - Set up modern development environment with hot module replacement, TypeScript strict mode, and production build optimization.
    - Resolved TypeScript compilation issues including styled-components theme typing, import syntax, and Framer Motion type assertions.
    - Created comprehensive META.md documentation for all major frontend modules following atomic documentation principles.
    - Implemented real-time backend API health checking with visual status indicators and automatic connection monitoring.
    - Built responsive design system adapting Dadaist principles across screen sizes while maintaining accessibility compliance.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration Foundation:**
    - Established API client architecture for consuming all 20+ SmartHistory REST endpoints with proper error handling.
    - Created live backend connection testing displaying real-time API status (checking/connected/error states).
    - Implemented development workflow allowing simultaneous frontend (localhost:5173) and backend (localhost:8000) development.
    - Designed extensible component system ready for dashboard implementation, data visualizations, and user authentication interfaces.
- **Design System Evaluation & Future Considerations:**
    - **Current State:** Fully functional Dadaist frontend with artistic chaos elements, unconventional layouts, and playful interactions.
    - **Design Flexibility Note:** Architecture built with adaptable styling system allowing future design direction changes without structural modifications.
    - **Styling Adjustment Requirements:** Current Dadaist implementation requires significant styling refinements and may transition to more conventional design patterns.
    - **Component Reusability:** Atomic component structure ensures easy restyling - core functionality remains intact regardless of visual design direction.
