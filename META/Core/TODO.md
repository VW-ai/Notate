## Notes

### Design Decisions
- Chose 280px width for tag panel (balance between visibility and screen space)
- Used #2C2C2E background to distinguish from timeline (#1C1C1E)
- Top 8 most-used tags shown (not top 10) for better mobile adaptation
- Tag format for events: `[tags: tag1, tag2]` in notes field

### Future Considerations
- Consider moving event tags to custom Calendar field if possible
- Evaluate need for tag categories/groups
- Consider tag autocomplete from external sources (project names, etc.)
- Explore tag sharing/collaboration features
