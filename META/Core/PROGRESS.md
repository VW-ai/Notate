# Development Progress

## Session: 2025-10-20 - Pin Functionality Implementation

### Completed Features

#### 1. Pin/Unpin System for Entries and Events
- **Data Model Updates**:
  - Added `isPinned: Bool` property to Entry model
  - Added helper methods: `togglePin()`, `pin()`, `unpin()`
  - Created `PinManager.swift` singleton for managing pinned calendar event IDs
  - Added `isPinned` computed property to CalendarEvent
  - Database migration to add `is_pinned` column to existing installations

- **Storage Implementation**:
  - Entries: `is_pinned` column in SQLite database (INTEGER, default 0)
  - Events: PinManager stores pinned event IDs in UserDefaults
  - Database index on `is_pinned` column for efficient queries
  - Automatic migration for existing databases

#### 2. Pin UI Components
- **Detail View Pin Buttons**:
  - Pin/unpin button in upper left corner (parallel with close button)
  - Icon-only design: `pin.fill` (yellow) when unpinned, `pin.slash.fill` (orange) when pinned
  - Immediate visual feedback with local state management
  - Size: 20pt icon
  - Location: `SimpleEntryDetailView.swift`, `SimpleEventDetailView.swift`

- **Pin Indicators on Cards**:
  - Yellow pin icon (11pt) displayed on all pinned items
  - Entry timeline cards: Pin icon next to title
  - Event timeline cards: Pin icon in title row
  - List page preview cards: Pin icon before timestamp
  - Consistent placement across all card types

#### 3. Pinned Section in Timeline View
- **Dedicated Pinned Section**:
  - Appears at top of timeline (above Midnight section)
  - Header: "Pinned 📌"
  - Only shown when there are pinned entries or events
  - Shows pinned items for currently selected date
  - Separate from time-based sections

#### 4. Pinned Collection in List View
- **Collection Update**:
  - "Pinned" collection now shows actually pinned items (not placeholder)
  - Mode-aware counts (Notes/Events/Both)
  - `getPinnedCount()` method respects view mode selection
  - Filters work correctly for pinned entries and events
  - Badge displays accurate count

#### 5. Technical Implementation Details
- **Synchronous Updates to Prevent Flashing**:
  - In-memory array updates happen synchronously on main thread
  - Database saves occur on background queue
  - No reload after save to prevent race conditions
  - Fixed flash issue by updating `.id()` modifier to include pin state

- **Race Condition Fixes**:
  - ListView prefers `appState.selectedEntry` over array lookup
  - Thread-safe updates with proper main thread checks
  - Removed redundant `loadEntriesInternal()` call after saves
  - Proper state management with `@State private var isPinned`

- **View Recreation Strategy**:
  - Changed `.id(entry.id)` to `.id("\(entry.id)-\(entry.isPinned)")`
  - Forces view recreation when pin state changes
  - Ensures fresh initialization with correct pin state
  - Applied to both Timeline and List views

   - Adds `is_pinned` column with `ALTER TABLE` if missing
   - Safe for existing installations (defaults to 0/unpinned)
   - Automatic execution on app startup

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Synchronous in-memory updates on main thread when called from UI
   - Async updates when called from background threads
   - Proper thread safety with `Thread.isMainThread` checks
   - No blocking operations on main thread

3. **State Management**:
   - Local `@State` for immediate UI feedback
   - AppState updates for persistence
   - PinManager @Published property for event pin state
   - Proper SwiftUI view identity with composite IDs

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Database index on `is_pinned` column
   - No reload after individual saves
   - Cached pin state in PinManager
   - Minimal UI rerenders with targeted updates

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Pin button appears in entry detail view
- [x] Pin button appears in event detail view
- [x] Clicking pin button immediately updates icon
- [x] Pin state persists after closing detail view
- [x] Pin state persists after app restart (entries)
- [x] Pin state persists after app restart (events via PinManager)
- [x] Pin indicators appear on timeline cards
- [x] Pin indicators appear on list preview cards
- [x] Pinned section shows in Timeline view
- [x] Pinned section only shows when items are pinned
- [x] Pinned collection in List view shows correct items
- [x] Pinned counts are accurate and mode-aware
- [x] No flash when toggling pin state
- [x] Database migration runs successfully on existing installations
- [x] Both entries and events can be pinned/unpinned
- [x] Multiple items can be pinned simultaneously

### Known Issues / Future Enhancements

1. **No Keyboard Shortcut**: Pin/unpin action only available via button click
2. **No Pinned Sorting**: Pinned items shown in chronological order (not pinned-first in regular sections)
3. **No Pin Limit**: No maximum number of pins enforced
4. **No Pin Analytics**: No tracking of most-pinned items or pin duration

### Design Decisions

- **Color Scheme**: Yellow (#FFD60A) for unpinned, orange for pinned (matches warm palette)
- **Icon Choice**: `pin.fill` and `pin.slash.fill` for clarity
- **Placement**: Upper left parallel with close button (consistent across detail views)
- **Storage**: Entries use database column, events use PinManager (Calendar.app limitations)
- **Section Position**: Pinned section at very top of timeline (most prominent)

## Session: 2025-10-18 (Evening) - List Page Development & Refinement

### Completed Features

#### 1. List Page Selector System
- **Location**: `Notate/Views/ListView.swift`
- **Horizontal Selector Layout**:
  - Three selectors in parallel: `[Years] [Modes] [Months]`
  - 80pt top spacing to match Timeline page
  - No dividers between selector groups
  - Single row design for compact UI

- **Year Selector**:
  - 7 square buttons (selectedYear -3 to +3)
  - Rounded rectangle shape with 8pt corners
  - Light yellow background for current year
  - Bright yellow for selected year
  - Events fetch dynamically based on selected year

- **Mode Selector**:
  - Three modes: Notes, Both, Events
  - Light yellow background for "Both" mode (always visible)
  - Same styling as date selector from Timeline
  - Mode-aware tag counts and collection counts

- **Month Selector**:
  - 12 circular month buttons (JAN-DEC) + ALL TIME
  - Single row layout (previously 2 rows)
  - Light yellow background for current month
  - Light yellow background for ALL TIME button
  - Smaller buttons (36px) to fit in one row

#### 2. ItemColorManager System
- **File**: `Notate/Managers/ItemColorManager.swift`
- **Centralized Color Management**:
  - Singleton manager for entry/event colors
  - Future-ready for AI categorization
  - Current implementations:
    - All-day events: Light red (#FF6B6B)
    - Regular events: Bright green (#66FF99)
    - Entries: Bright blue (#66D9FF)

- **Smart Color Application**:
  - All-day events show date only (no time)
  - Different date formats: "Oct 31 · 2:00 PM" vs "Oct 31"
  - Colored vertical lines on preview cards

#### 3. Recurring Events Fix
- **Problem Solved**: Recurring events shared same ID, causing view reuse bugs
- **Solution**: Added `uniqueID` computed property to CalendarEvent
- **Implementation**:
  - `uniqueID = "\(id)-\(startTime.timeIntervalSince1970)"`
  - Each occurrence gets unique identifier
  - Fixed ordering issues in Both and Events modes
  - Eliminated duplicate ID warnings

#### 4. Layout & Spacing Fixes
- **Fixed Height Preview Cards**:
  - All cards: `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, idealHeight: 62, maxHeight: 62)`
  - Added `.clipped()` to prevent overflow
  - Eliminated massive gaps between events
  - Consistent card heights across modes

- **UI Consistency**:
  - Removed dividers between collection/preview/detail panels
  - Removed divider under search bar
  - Removed dividers from TagManagementPanel
  - All panels use same background (#1C1C1E)

#### 5. Time Range Filtering
- **Year-Based Filtering**:
  - Events fetched from selected year only (Jan 1 - Dec 31)
  - Entries filtered by selected year
  - "ALL TIME" means all months in selected year

- **Month Filtering**:
  - Filters by selected month within selected year
  - Works correctly with mode selection
  - Collection counts respect time filters

#### 6. Collection Count System
- **Mode-Aware Counts**:
  - "All" count varies based on Notes/Both/Events mode
  - "Recent" count filters by time range and mode
  - Tag counts respect mode, year, and month selections

- **Proper Filtering**:
  - `getAllCount()` filters by time range
  - `getRecentCount()` filters by time range + recency
  - `getTagCount()` filters by time range + mode

### Technical Improvements

1. **Data Management**:
   - Cached all events in `@State` variable
   - Single source of truth for event data
   - Detail pane uses cached events instead of service

2. **UnifiedItem System**:
   - Merged entries and events for Both mode
   - Proper sorting with stable sort algorithm
   - Unique IDs prevent SwiftUI view reuse

3. **Date Formatting**:
   - `formattedDate()` for regular events (with time)
   - `formattedDateOnly()` for all-day events (date only)
   - Consistent formatting across modes

4. **Layout Architecture**:
   - Three-pane layout: 20% / 30% / 50%
   - Fixed card heights prevent spacing issues
   - LazyVStack with spacing: 0

#### 7. Detail View Integration Fix
- **Problem Solved**: Detail views weren't rendering in List page
- **Root Causes**:
  - Missing `.environmentObject(appState)` on detail views
  - Missing GeometryReader for proper sizing context
  - Missing `.id()` modifier for view recreation
- **Solution**:
  - Wrapped detail views in GeometryReader
  - Added `.frame(width:)` and `.frame(minHeight:)` for proper sizing
  - Added `.environmentObject(appState)` for state access
  - Added `.id(entry.id)` / `.id(event.id)` for proper view updates
  - Used `event.uniqueID` for selection but `event.id` for view identity

## Session: 2025-10-18 (Afternoon) - Timer System Implementation

### Completed Features

#### 1. Comprehensive Timer Workflow System
- **Location**: `Notate/Views/TimerPopupWindow.swift`, `Notate/Managers/TimerPopupManager.swift`
- **Features**:
  - Unified popup window with 5 distinct modes:
    - Event name input (when `;;;` typed alone)
    - Tag selection (after timer stopped)
    - Running timer status (during active tracking)
    - Conflict resolution (starting while timer running)
    - Event completion/editing (review before save)

- **Timer Start Workflow**:
  - Type `;;;` (empty) → Popup + notification for event name input
  - Type `;;;event name` → Start timer immediately with notification
  - NO tags required at start - tags selected after stopping

- **Timer Running**:
  - Type `;;;` while running → Show running timer popup with live duration
  - Press Enter or click "Stop Timer" → Show tag selection popup
  - Escape closes popup without stopping timer

- **Conflict Handling**:
  - Type `;;;` or `;;;event name` while timer running → Conflict popup
  - Must stop current timer before starting new one
  - After stopping, proceeds to tag selection, then starts new timer if applicable

#### 2. Tag Selection Improvements
- **Removed Keyboard Number Selection**:
  - Eliminated number keys (1-9) for tag selection
  - Changed to click-only interaction for better UX
  - Updated UI labels: "Quick tags (click to select)"

- **Live Tag Filtering**:
  - Implemented real-time tag search as user types
  - Uses `TagStore.searchTags()` for efficient filtering
  - Shows matching tags in scrollable list (max height: 120px)
  - Filters exclude already-selected tags
  - Quick tags hidden when search active

- **Visual Design**:
  - Tag colors from TagColorManager displayed consistently
  - Selected tags show checkmark icon in filtered list
  - Tag pills with colored backgrounds and remove buttons

#### 3. Notification Integration
- **System Notifications** (`SystemNotificationManager.swift`):
  - Timer name input notification with text field action
  - Unique notification IDs (timestamp-based) ensure always visible
  - Click notification → Opens appropriate popup
  - Text input in notification → Starts timer directly
  - Notification categories with `UNTextInputNotificationAction`

- **Popup-Notification Coordination**:
  - Using popup dismisses corresponding notification
  - Using notification dismisses popup if open
  - Singleton `TimerPopupManager` prevents duplicate popups
  - Only ONE popup visible at a time

#### 4. Window Management & Fullscreen Support
- **NSPanel-Based Architecture**:
  - Uses NSPanel for better fullscreen app compatibility
  - Window level: `CGWindowLevelForKey(.mainMenuWindow) + 2`
  - Appears over fullscreen applications reliably
  - Collection behavior: `canJoinAllSpaces`, `fullScreenAuxiliary`

- **Smart Activation Logic**:
  - Event name input: No app activation (user stays in current app)
  - Tag selection/timer views: Full activation with keyboard/mouse
  - Hides all other Notate windows except popup
  - `orderFrontRegardless()` ensures popup visibility

- **Interactive Window Properties**:
  - Override `canBecomeKey` and `canBecomeMain` to accept input
  - `.focusable()` modifier on SwiftUI views
  - Clickable buttons alongside keyboard shortcuts
  - Proper first responder management

#### 5. In-App Consistency
- **Operator Panel Integration** (`OperatorView.swift`):
  - Stop timer button → Shows creation detail view (same as keyboard workflow)
  - No longer directly saves timer - allows tag addition/editing
  - Consistent workflow between keyboard and in-app actions

- **Timeline Auto-Refresh**:
  - Added `CalendarService.shared.fetchEvents()` after timer save
  - Timeline immediately reflects new timer events
  - No manual refresh needed

#### 6. Visual Design Unification
- **Uniform Button Design**:
  - All popups use consistent button styling
  - Big buttons with keyboard shortcut hints (⏎, ⎋)
  - Color-coded actions:
    - Primary action: White on colored background
    - Secondary: Transparent with border
    - Danger/conflict: Orange background

- **Running Timer Visual**:
  - Sliding bar background animation (tomato clock aesthetic)
  - Live duration counter (HH:MM:SS format)
  - Tag pills displayed below event name
  - Red-tinted background (#8B3A3A)

- **Tag Selection Popup**:
  - 20% taller than other popups (384px vs 320px)
  - Increased top/bottom padding (24px)
  - Removed "Selected:" label (unnecessary visual clutter)
  - Tags show with assigned colors throughout

### Technical Improvements

1. **Trigger System Migration**:
   - Added `;;;` trigger to TriggerConfiguration
   - Migration logic ensures trigger exists in all installations
   - `isTimerTrigger` flag distinguishes timer from regular triggers

2. **State Management**:
   - Timer state managed by `OperatorState.shared`
   - Popup state managed by `TimerPopupManager.shared`
   - Notification state tracked for dismissal coordination
   - AppState orchestrates entire workflow

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Enum-based popup modes prevent invalid states
   - Completion closures with proper type signatures
   - SwiftUI property wrappers (@State, @FocusState, @StateObject)

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Separated popup modes into distinct view structs
   - Computed properties for complex UI elements
   - MARK comments for clear section boundaries
   - Extracted helper methods for event name handling

  - Displays all tags sorted by usage count
  - Shows tag count badges with color-coded styling
  - Empty state UI when no tags exist
  - Clean, modular code structure with computed properties

#### 2. Tag Creation System
- **Easy Tag Creation**:
  - Click + button in panel header to create new tags
  - Inline text field with blue accent styling
  - Press Enter to confirm, X button to cancel
  - Tags get random colors automatically on first use

#### 3. Drag-and-Drop Tagging
- **Drag Sources**:
  - `PieceTimelineCard.swift`: Entries are draggable
  - `TimePeriodSection.swift` (StretchableEventCard): Calendar events are draggable
  - Drag data format: `"entry:ID"` or `"event:EventID"`

- **Drop Targets**:
  - Each tag in panel is a drop target
  - Visual feedback: Tags highlight when hovered with dragged items
  - Smooth animations for hover states
  - Automatic tag assignment on drop

- **Tag Assignment Logic**:
  - For entries: Adds tag to entry.tags array via AppState
  - For events: Updates Calendar event notes with `[tags: tag1, tag2]` format
  - Prevents duplicate tags
  - Real-time sync with Calendar app

#### 4. Tag Color System (72 Colors)
- **File**: `Notate/Managers/TagColorManager.swift`
- **Features**:
  - 72 distinct, visually pleasing colors across spectrum
  - Random color assignment for new tags
  - Smart algorithm prioritizes unused colors
  - Color persistence via UserDefaults
  - Singleton pattern for app-wide access
  - Colors applied to:
    - Tag pills in entry/event detail views
    - Tag indicators in management panel
    - Count badges

#### 5. Tag Suggestions & Autocomplete
- **In Detail Views** (`SimpleEntryDetailView.swift`, `SimpleEventDetailView.swift`):
  - Shows top 8 most-used tags when input field is empty
  - Filters tags based on user input
  - Clickable suggestion pills
  - Excludes tags already on current entry/event
  - Horizontal scrollable layout

#### 6. UI Integration
- **TimelineView Updates**:
  - Tag panel positioned on far left
  - Proper layout management with detail panel
  - Toggle button in date navigation header
  - Smooth animations for panel show/hide

### Technical Improvements

1. **Type Safety Fixes**:
   - Fixed Entry.id type (String, not UUID)
   - Fixed CalendarService property name (events, not allEvents)
   - Proper type signatures throughout drag-and-drop system

2. **Import Management**:
   - Added `import Combine` to TagColorManager for ObservableObject
   - Added `import UniformTypeIdentifiers` for drag-and-drop

3. **Compiler Optimization**:
   - Broke down complex View body into computed properties
   - Resolved type-checking timeout issues
   - Used maxWidth instead of width for proper frame constraints

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Separated concerns with MARK comments
   - Extracted helper functions
   - Modular view components (TagDropTarget)

### Files Modified/Created

#### Created:
- `Notate/Views/TagManagementPanel.swift` - Main tag panel with drag-and-drop
- `Notate/Managers/TagColorManager.swift` - Color management system

## Session 2025-10-20 - Analysis Page Implementation

**Duration**: Extended session with multiple user feedback iterations
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Integrated

### Overview

Implemented comprehensive time analytics page with 7 interactive visualizations showing calendar event data analysis. Major focus on matching existing design language (borderless, dark theme, yellow highlights) and fixing tag extraction from calendar event notes.

### Files Created

#### Data Models
- `Notate/Models/AnalyticsModels.swift` - Core data structures
  - `TimeRange` enum with 7 options (Today, Week, Month, Quarter, Year, All Time, Custom)
  - `TimeAnalytics` struct with computed properties

  - Date range calculation logic for all time ranges

#### View Model
- `Notate/ViewModels/AnalysisViewModel.swift` - Analytics engine (350+ lines)
  - Async/await data loading from CalendarService
  - Tag extraction from event notes (`[tags: tag1, tag2]` format)
  - Time aggregation by tag, day, hour, week
  - 7×24 heatmap generation (hourly activity by weekday)
  - Session duration bucketing
  - Week-over-week comparison metrics
  - Smart insights generation (6 insight types)
  - CSV and JSON export functionality

#### Main View

   - Count of sessions per bucket
   - Highlights deep focus (2h+) sessions

6. **WeeklyTrendChart.swift** - Line chart
   - 12 weeks of historical data
   - Total hours per week
   - Gradient area fill

### Technical Fixes

#### Compilation Errors Fixed

1. **ViewBuilder Return Statements** (WeeklyTrendChart, TimeOfDayHeatmap)
   - Removed explicit `return` keywords in Preview contexts
   - SwiftUI ViewBuilder syntax compliance

2. **Type Conversion - .reversed()** (WeeklyTrendChart, DailyDistributionChart)
   - Wrapped `ReversedCollection` with `Array()` constructor
   - Fixed type mismatch errors

3. **Missing Import** (AnalysisView)
   - Added `import UniformTypeIdentifiers` for `.commaSeparatedText` and `.json` types

4. **Complex Expression Timeout** (DailyDistributionChart)
   - Broke complex Chart expression into local variable
   - Reduced type-checker complexity

5. **Generic Parameter Inference** (DailyDistributionChart)
   - Removed `.chartForegroundStyleScale()` modifier
   - Applied colors directly to BarMarks: `.foregroundStyle(getColor(for:))`
   - Added `stacking: .standard` parameter

#### Bug Fixes

**Tag Extraction Not Working** - Critical fix
- **Problem**: All events showing as untagged despite having tags
- **Root Cause**: Wrong regex pattern (looking for `#tag1` instead of `[tags: tag1, tag2]`)
- **Solution**: Updated `extractTags()` to match SimpleEventDetailView format
  ```swift
  let pattern = "\\[tags: ([^\\]]+)\\]"
  let tagsString = String(notes[tagsRange])
  return tagsString.split(separator: ",").map { $0.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces) }
  ```
- **Added**: `#` prefix when displaying tags for consistency

### Design Evolution

#### Iteration 1: Font Sizes Too Small
**User Feedback**: "one problem the words are too small"

**Changes Applied**:
- Section headers: `.caption` → `.headline`
- Stats card values: `.title2` → `.title`
- Button text: `.caption` → `.callout`
- Insights: `.title3` → `.title2`, `.callout` → `.body`
- Chart annotations: increased by 2-3 points

#### Iteration 2: Design Language Mismatch
**User Feedback**: "can we posse the same design language as our previous page, where try to eliminate border, and use the same background color as the others, and on top, in the middle, are our selectors, not to the right"

**Changes Applied**:
- Removed all `.cornerRadius()` and border strokes
- Changed all backgrounds to `Color(hex: "#1C1C1E")`
- Moved time range selector from toolbar to top-center layout
- Added 80px top spacer matching Timeline/List views
- Used translucent overlays `Color.white.opacity(0.05)` instead of borders
- Removed navigation toolbar controls

#### Iteration 3: Button Styling
**User Feedback**: "the selector buttons, should be bigger, and unselected it should be yellow, just like the mode selector button in list view"

**Analysis**: Examined ListView mode selector implementation

**Changes Applied**:
- Selected state: `#FFD60A` (yellow) background, dark text, 56px height, 18pt bold
- Unselected state: `#3A3A3C` (gray) background, secondary text, 48px height, 14pt semibold
- Min width: 100px
- Corner radius: 12px
- Spring animation: `response: 0.5, dampingFraction: 0.7`
- Applied to all range buttons and custom picker button

### Integration

- ✅ Updated `InsightsView.swift` to use `AnalysisView()`
- ✅ Wired to bottom navigation "Analysis" tab
- ✅ Uses `CalendarService` for direct EventKit access
- ✅ Integrates with `TagColorManager` for consistent colors
- ✅ Follows Notate dark theme design system
- ✅ Export to CSV and JSON with native save dialogs

### Data Architecture Discussion

**User Question**: "why are we using the calendar directly instead of database's events though?"

**Answer**:
- Calendar events have **duration** (start/end times) → essential for TIME analysis
- Database entries have only single **timestamp** → suitable for activity/frequency tracking
- Time analytics requires duration calculations → must use calendar events
- Current approach is correct for time-tracking visualizations

### Technical Highlights

- Swift Charts framework (native macOS 13+)
- Async/await with proper error handling
- Type-safe analytics models
- Regex tag extraction with proper escaping
- Memory-efficient aggregation algorithms
- Edge case handling (empty data, untagged events, all-day events)
- Export with auto-generated ISO8601 filenames
- Week-over-week metrics calculation
- Custom heatmap rendering with 168 cells (7×24)

### Known Limitations

- Does not analyze database entries (no duration data)
- Tag extraction depends on specific format in notes field
- Custom date range state stored in view model (not persisted)
- Export is synchronous (may block UI for large datasets)

### Files Modified

- `Notate/Views/InsightsView.swift` - Replaced placeholder with AnalysisView

### Total Code Added

- **15 new files** (~2000+ lines of Swift/SwiftUI code)
- **1 file modified**
- All files compile without warnings
- Full integration with existing services
