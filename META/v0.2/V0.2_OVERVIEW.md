# Notate v0.2 - Transformation Overview

**Vision:** Evolve Notate from a functional capture tool into a refined, intelligent productivity companion with a distinctive visual identity.

---

## What's Changing?

### 1. Visual Identity üé®
**Before:** Generic Apple-inspired interface
**After:** Distinctive Notate aesthetic with:
- Muted slate color palette (inspired by logo)
- Neural blue accents for AI features
- Softer, more organic feel than standard macOS apps
- Breathing micro-interactions
- Unified design language

**Key Documents:**
- [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](./DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) - Complete visual specification

---

### 2. User Experience üöÄ

#### Feedback System
**Problem:** No visibility into capture/processing status
**Solution:** Multi-layer notification system
- Immediate toast on capture
- Processing indicators on entries
- Completion notifications with stats
- Action execution feedback

#### TODO Behavior
**Problem:** TODOs can be marked done then undone, causing confusion
**Solution:** One-way completion with confirmation
- Checkbox requires confirmation dialog
- Completed TODOs move to read-only Archive
- Celebration animation on completion
- No undo capability (archive is final)

#### Unified Entry Design
**Problem:** TODOs and Pieces look completely different
**Solution:** Single card component for all entry types
- Same base layout and interactions
- Type differentiation via:
  - Left accent bar color (amber for TODO, purple for Piece)
  - Icon (checkbox vs sparkle)
  - Metadata (priority for TODOs, tags for Pieces)
- Consistent hover, selection, and animation states

### 3. AI Intelligence üß†

#### Auto-Execute Actions
**Current:** AI suggests ‚Üí User clicks "Execute" ‚Üí User clicks "Jump"
**New:** AI suggests ‚Üí Auto-executes ‚Üí User clicks "View"

**Benefits:**
- True automation (not just suggestions)
- Fewer steps to completion
- Calendar events, reminders created instantly
- User can disable per action type in Settings

#### Tagging System
**Current:** Web search integration (rarely useful)
**New:** Smart tagging powered by AI
- AI extracts relevant tags during processing
- Tag autocomplete based on frequency
- Tag-based filtering and search
- Tag analytics (most used, trending)
- Foundation for smart collections

**Key Documents:**
- [AI_UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./AI_UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) - AI system architecture

### 4. Advanced Features ‚ö°

#### Clipboard Support
- Monitors clipboard for trigger patterns
- Offers to create entries from copied text
- Privacy-respecting (can be disabled)
- Useful for web content capture

#### Time Tracking Infrastructure
- Database fields for time analysis
- AI estimates task duration
- Foundation for future analytics dashboard
- Tracks view count, completion time

#### Pomodoro Timer
- Start timer directly from keyboard trigger
- Example: `/// timer 25m write report`
- Menubar integration
- Widget support for active timers
- Logs sessions to entries

## What Gets Removed?

### Web Search Integration
**Why:** Low value, adds complexity, doesn't fit capture workflow

**Replacement:** Intelligent tagging system provides better organization

**Migration:** Existing entries with web search results keep them (read-only), but no new web search actions created

---

### TODO Undo Capability
**Why:** Causes confusion, undermines archive reliability, no clear "done" moment

**Replacement:** Confirmation dialog before completion, celebration animation

**Migration:** No data changes needed - just remove UI capability

---

## What Stays the Same?

### Core Capture Mechanism ‚úÖ
- Keyboard triggers (///, ,,,, etc.)
- Auto-clear input field
- Multilingual support
- Cross-app compatibility

### Database & Security ‚úÖ
- SQLite with encryption
- Local-only storage
- Keychain integration
- Export functionality

### AI Processing ‚úÖ
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 integration
- Structured extraction
- Research briefs
- Tool calling

### Configuration ‚úÖ
- Custom triggers
- Type mapping
- Permission management
- Settings panel

---

## Migration Path

### Database
**Current version:** Schema v2
**Target version:** Schema v3

**Changes:**
- Add time tracking columns
- Add tag analytics table
- No breaking changes to existing data

**Migration:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE entries ADD COLUMN viewed_at INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE entries ADD COLUMN view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE entries ADD COLUMN estimated_duration_seconds INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE entries ADD COLUMN completed_at INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE entries ADD COLUMN pomodoro_sessions TEXT;

CREATE TABLE tags (
    tag TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    last_used INTEGER
);
```

**Safety:**
- All new columns nullable or have defaults
- Existing entries continue working
- Export before migration recommended

---

### Code
**Approach:** Incremental replacement
- Keep old components alongside new during transition
- Feature flags for risky changes
- Gradual rollout per phase

**Backwards compatibility:**
- v0.1 databases work in v0.2
- No data loss
- Settings preserved

---

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Capture latency:** < 50ms (maintained)
- **Processing feedback:** 100% visible
- **TODO completion clarity:** Zero confusion
- **Action execution:** 90% success rate

### Technical
- **Performance:** 60fps maintained
- **Database queries:** < 10ms average
- **Clipboard monitoring:** < 5% CPU
- **Memory:** < 100MB typical usage

### Design
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance
- **Dark mode:** Full support
- **Consistency:** 100% components use design system
- **Animation:** Smooth, 60fps

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: TODO Undo Removal Backlash
**Mitigation:**
- Clear messaging in release notes
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidents
- Archive provides permanent record
- Can add "restore" feature later if needed

### Risk: Auto-Execute Privacy Concerns
**Mitigation:**
- All auto-execute disabled by default
- Explicit settings per action type
- Permission requests system-level
- "Cautious mode" for paranoid users

### Risk: Performance Degradation
**Mitigation:**
- Benchmarks for each phase
- Performance tests in CI
- Lazy loading for large lists
- Debouncing for search/clipboard

### Risk: Migration Failures
**Mitigation:**
- Database backup before migration
- Rollback script prepared
- Phased rollout (internal ‚Üí beta ‚Üí public)
- Migration tested on sample databases
